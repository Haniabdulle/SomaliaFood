        <h1>Somali cuisine</h1>
        <p>Somali cuisine is the traditional cuisine of Somalis from the Horn of Africa. Somali cuisine does have moderate foreign influence from different countries mainly due to trade but traditionally also varies from region to region due to the expansive landmass Somalis inhabit with traditions varying in different regions which makes it a fusion of differing Somali culinary traditions.[1] It is the product of Somalia's tradition of trade and commerce. Some notable Somali delicacies include Kimis/Sabaayad, Canjeero/Lahoh, Xalwo (Halwa), Sambuusa (Samosa), Bariis Iskukaris, and Muqmad/Odkac.

            Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Somalia, in accordance with Sharia, the Islamic law.</p>

        <h2>Breakfast</h2>
        <p>Breakfast (Quraac) is an important meal for Somalis, who often start the day with Somali style tea (shaah/shaax) or coffee (qaxwa). The tea, brewed from black tea leaves, can be served regularly as-is (shaah rinji or shaah bigays); but it can be also flavoured with spices such as ginger, cardamom and cinnamon (though black pepper is not used unlike other spiced teas) while milk is added after the brewing instead of during it; this is known as shaah cadeys.[2]

            The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread called a canjeero or lahoh originating in Somalia[3][4] and is eaten in different ways. It is often eaten along with Honey and Ghee /Olive oil/Sesame oil and washed down with a cup of Tea. It may also be broken into small pieces with Somali Ghee (Subag) and sugar. For children, it is mixed with tea and Sesame oil/Olive oil (Macsaro) until mushy. Typically there may be a side dish of liver (usually beef), goat meat (hilib ari), diced beef cooked in a bed of soup (suqaar), or odkac, which consists of small dried pieces of beef, goat or camel meat, boiled in ghee. Different from Ethiopian Injera, Somali Canjeero is smaller, thinner and sweeter. It might also be eaten with a stew (Maraq) or soup.[5]
            
            Sabaayad or Kimis/Cesh is another type of flatbread which is similar to the Desi Paratha. During lunch, Kimis/Sabaayad is sometimes consumed with Somali Curry, Soup, or Stew.
            Muufo[6] is another type of Somali Flatbread popular within South Somalia and is usually eaten with Stews and Soup but is also sometimes eaten at breakfast with Honey/Sugar, Sesame oil, Subag and Black tea
            Mushaari or Boorash (porridge), with Butter, Nuts and Sugar is eaten across Somalia.
            Nationally, a sweeter and greasy version of Canjeero, similar to a crepe known as Malawax or Malawah is a staple of most home-cooked meals and is usually eaten for breakfast with Tea, similarly to how Canjeero is eaten.
